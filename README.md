# SoPC_Timer_Clock
This program aims to develop a real-time clock system capable of managing and displaying time (hours, minutes, seconds) within an FPGA environment. The system utilizes the hardware components of the DE10-Standard board, including a timer module, seven-segment LED displays for output visualization, and physical switches for controlling clock functions.

Figure 1. Overview of the Hardware System

The program utilizes Quartus 18.1 along with the Nios II software for execution.

* Overall Functionality
- Time Display: The clock displays real-time (hours:minutes:seconds) on six 7-segment LEDs (2 for hours, 2 for minutes, 2 for seconds).

- Control via Switches:
SW0: Resets the time to 0.
SW1: Stops (ON) or resumes (OFF) the timer.
SW2: Increases speed (ON, 5MHz) or returns to normal speed (OFF, 50MHz).
Timer Speed: Can operate at 50MHz (1 real second â‰ˆ 1 counted second) or 5MHz (10 times faster).

- Time Update: The timer generates periodic interrupts to increment the counter and update the display.
